# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

C programming language is a mother language for most modern programming language and having skills in this language will make it easy to learn other languages.
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by Holberton School. I am learning about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:


* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - debugging](./0x03-debugging)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x08. C - Recursion](./0x08-recursion)
* [0x09. C - Static libraries](./0x09-static_libraries)
* [0x0A. C - argc, argv](./0x0A-argc_argv)
* [0x0B. C - malloc, free](./0x0B-malloc_free)
* [0x0C. C - More malloc, free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free)
* [0x0D. C - Preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor)
* [0x0E. C - Structures, typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef)
* [0x0F. C - Function pointers](./0x0F-function_pointers)
* [0x10. C - Variadic functions](./0x10-variadic_functions)
* [0x11. C - printf](https://github.com/Faitholo/printf)
* [0x12. C - Singly linked lists](./0x12-singly_linked_lists)


- I will be updating this repo as I complete more tasks
- Being a Software Engineer has been long cherished desire that I'm now on my way to fulfilling.
